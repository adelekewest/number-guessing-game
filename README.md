This a simple guess the number game. It would choose a random number between 1 and 100, then challenge the player to guess the number in 10 turns. After each turn, the player would be told if they are right or wrong,and if they are wrong, whether the guess was too low or too high. It would also tell players what number they previously guessed.THe game would end once the player guesses correctly, or once they run out of turns. When the game ends, the player would be given an option to start playing again.
